# Adult_Income_Preds
## This repository has been created to demonstrate the various correlations and trends present in the Adult Income data set found here, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset.

This data set contains information on thousands of respondants ranging from age to education levels to country of origin and many more. I will use this data to predict and show trends in relation to the target, 'income', represented in the dataset as <=50k and >50k.
